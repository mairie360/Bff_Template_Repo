-- The test JWTs reference two users:
--   * sub = "1": Admin role. docker-compose-security.yml injects a static token for it
--     through the ZAP replacer, so every operation is scanned authenticated;
--   * sub = "2": User role only, for the performance test.
-- Add here the rows that the examples of the contract name (ids of path parameters,
-- referenced users...), with a distinct row for the examples of the DELETE routes.
